Documentation for test.js
Testing HTTP API that used by the frontend.

Usage: node test.js

Defined tests:
    testRegister - testing POST /register API.
Verifying valid & invalid cases:
response 200 has 'set-cookie' header;
response 500 has JSON with msg field;
    
    testLogin - testing POST /login API.
Verifying the same test cases as for /register.
Additionaly, checking that illegal credentials cause /login to fail with response 500.
Using setUp phase to register new user with /register API.


    testItem - testing all defined APIs for /item:
GET /item - retrieves full list of todo items.
POST /item - adds new todo item to the list.
PUT /item - updates existing item, or sets 'completed' status for all items.
DELETE /item - removes either specific item, or all completed items.

testItem reproduces certain flow scenario to cover the most of the use cases for all those APIs.
Previous subtests used as setup phase for the following.
Additionaly, setup phase used to register new user and to login for that user (producing invalidated session id).

Each API tested for: valid usage, invalid itemID values.
GET /item used to verify list consistency.
Also, during testItem, /login API tested for invalidating previous sessions of user.
