todoApp
===========

todoApp is an Angular application for todo list. It's multiclient with single session per client.  
It's based on the todoMVC application from [todomvc.com](http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/angularjs/)  
All users data stored on the backend.  
The backend runs on top of mini_express Node module, and it's extremely easy to switch it to the Express node module.
